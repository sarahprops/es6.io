  /*
    spread '...' takes all of the items in an iterable and apply to it to the containing element
    lets say we have featured & specialty, then we make a pizzas, and tada
    we can spread it into a new array

    [...'wes'] = ['w', 'e', 's'];

    if you wanted to copy an array you could do
    fridayPizzas = pizzas, but if you change fridayPizzas at all, you change the OG array as well. before you could [].concat but thats weird
    so instead you take a new array and spread the old array into it
    TADA
