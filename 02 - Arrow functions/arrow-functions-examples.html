// above is OG but it errors, why? because if you take off {} its implicit, so how do you return a literal value while having curlys cause is object?, wrap in paran to show that its an object literal, not a function block
// console.table!!!!! WOAH LIFE CHANGED
// index is 0, so have to offset by 1
// race: race looks weird, so we can just say race since var and prop are the same
const win = winners.map((winner, i) => ({name: winner, race, place: i + 1}));

// const old = ages.filter(age => if(age > 60)) blah blah, but we no longer have to do that, filter only returns if true if the statement is true
const old = ages.filter(age => age >= 60);
