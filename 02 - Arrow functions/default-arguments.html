    default values are here!
    we want the total, the tax and the tip then return total

    the old way

    function calculateBill(total, tax, tip) {
      return total + (total * tax) + (total * tip);
    }

    const totalBill = calculateBill(100, 0.13, 0.15);
    console.log(totalBill);

    but happens if we want to assume that the tax is 13% and tip is 15%?
    before we would have to do is set up all this mumbo jumbo that says if it is undefined then have a default value
    or could do tax = tax || 0.13

    below: this means that if nothing is passed in, there is a default value
    how do you leave a variable off? tax doesnt change but tip does, just pass in undefined!

    return total + (total * tax) + (total * tip);
  }

  const totalBill = calculateBill(100, undefined, 0.25);
