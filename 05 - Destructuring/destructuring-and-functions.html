  // or put them in any order
  const bill = tipCalc({ tip: 0.20, total: 200 });
  console.log(bill);

  // if you pass in nothing, if default total is 100, just run tip calc, because it cannot match against nothing. have to have at least something for it to destructor against, but you can give it a default of blank, which will allow you to run the function
