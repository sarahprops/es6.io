  if we do it the traditional way
  const pizza = 'Deep Dish 🍕🍕🍕';
  console.log(pizza);
  then we get the variable and all is right in the world.

  but what happens if we do it BACKWARDS???
  my guess: undefined this is right byah, because the browser can see its created but not its value because it comes later
  if you change to const, it doesnt work at all because const is strict, u cannot access a variable before it is defined

  /*
  HOT TAKE IS VAR DEAD??????

  use const by default
  only use let is rebinding is need (you need to update)
  and var should not be used

  orrrrr

  use var for top level vars that are shared across many (large) scopes
  let for smaller scopes
  only use const if you are sure that a let doesn't need to be updated later
